# Loan Application Approval Prediction
Built a loan application approval prediction system using Machine Learning algorithms. Achieved an accuracy of 84% using SVM.

Used pandas to get values for the below queries:

- Find % of total applicants for each unique value of dependents.
- Find the average number of dependents per applicant.
- Find the %of applications approved for self-employed applicants.
- What is the % of rejections for married male applicants?
- Which property area has the maximum approval ratio.
- Find average dependents per income group.
- Create a simple predictive model to assess whether a loan application will be approved or rejected and provide the accuracy score.
